# rule-based-system---customer-selection
#This repository describes the use of a rule based system for customer selection of elective computer system components. 

#This system operates via forward chaining.  
#The forward chaining algorithms included in this repository have been adapted from a general forward chaining algorithm 
#published in course materials for the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learing module at the University of York Department of Computer Science.   

#The algorithms themselves (java files) and the output file are included separately from the explanation doc file.
